# TO show circuit breaker health metrics provided by application
management:
  health:
    circuitbreakers:
      enabled: true
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*" # Show all types of endpoints in actuator instead of only health metrics endpoints which are by default
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always # show complete health details of pour application

# Resilience4j Notes:
# To make Retry configuration work along with timeLimiter and circuit breaker, we need to change aspectOrder
# The default Resilience4j Aspects order is the following:
# Retry ( CircuitBreaker ( RateLimiter ( TimeLimiter ( Bulkhead ( Function ) ) ) ) )
# so Retry is applied at the end (if needed).
# As CircuitBreaker has a fallback, so it never throws an exception, so Retry never sees a failed invocation to retry
# So, Remove the Retry fallback, and change the aspect order so CircuitBreaker does its work after Retry.
